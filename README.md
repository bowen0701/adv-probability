# Advanced Probability Lecture Notes

This repo is to collect my notes for preparing my Statistics PhD qual exam for Advanced Probability in 2009. 

Nevertheless, the notes are only hand-written, and I do not have time to transform them into LaTex or Markdown documents yet; maybe I will try to find some time in the near future. :-)
